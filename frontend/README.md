# azure-cloud-resume
My own azure resume challenge, following ACG project video.

# First steps
- Frontend folder contains the website
- main.js contains code for counter
- index.html contains my resume in html format

# After a lot of time finding solution for "ERROR: unhandled error in functions worker: '_SixMetaPathImporter' object has no attribute '_path'". 
- Solution was to downgrade python to 3.11.9 

# Connection with CosmosDB
- Added and tested connection with CosmosDB. Firstly i wanted to do it using bindings, but was not getting it ready. So switched it to SDK and it works perfectly after some tests
- Added functionality to retrive data (id and count from CosmosDB) and each time someone enters HTTP trigger it adds 1 to it and replace it in CosmosDB

# Troubleshooting showing the visitor count into index.html
- After troubleshooting (Press F12 â†’ Console + Network), there were no errors with neither CORS, JSON or any other runtime errors.
So the issue was somewhere else.

```python
- Code before was a plain text. 

return func.HttpResponse(f"Document found: id={item['id']}, count={count}")

so instead of python dict:
{'id': '1', 'count': 42}


Adjusted it to:
return func.HttpResponse(
    json.dumps(body), 
    status_code=200, 
    mimetype="application/json"
)

So it returns json.dumps(body) in json format:
{"id": "1", "count": 42}
```
